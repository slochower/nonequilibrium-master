 abstract = {Biomolecular machines consume free energy to break symmetry and make directed
progress. Nonequilibrium ATP concentrations are the typical free energy source, with one cycle of a molecular machine consuming a certain number of ATP, providing a fixed free energy budget. Since evolution is expected to favor
rapid-turnover machines that operate efficiently, we investigate how this free
energy budget can be allocated to maximize flux. Unconstrained optimization
eliminates intermediate metastable states, indicating that flux is enhanced in
molecular machines with fewer states. When maintaining a set number of states, we show that---in contrast to previous findings---the flux-maximizing
allocation of dissipation is not even. This result is consistent with the
coexistence of both `irreversible' and reversible transitions in molecular
machine models that successfully describe experimental data, which suggests
that in evolved machines different transitions differ significantly in their
dissipation.},
